# hansi-threads

When a pull request has a Hansi summary comment (its body contains `<!-- hans:summary -->`) or review comments from the Hansi GitHub App:

- Do not call `resolveReviewThread`, and do not resolve those threads in the GitHub UI. A resolved thread stays open in Hansi's summary, so the tier stays capped.
- Fix the code, or reply on that thread. Hansi resolves the thread when a later review sees the fix, or when it dismisses the finding after the reply.
- `/hansi-status` reads the review. `/hansi-learn` saves a lasting rule. `/hansi-setup` changes `.hansi.json`. `/hansi-loop` fixes until Tier S.
