# hansi-learn

Save a lasting review rule by replying on the Hansi finding it applies to. Hansi stores the rule when a reply states a durable preference, then follows it on later reviews.

Do not request a review. Do not push. Do not call `resolveReviewThread`. Resolving a thread in GitHub leaves the finding open in Hansi's summary, so the tier stays capped. Hansi resolves the thread when it dismisses the finding.

The command blocks are examples, written for the GitHub CLI. Run whatever this environment actually provides to do the same job, including commands the examples do not list. If `gh` is missing, or a command fails because of how this machine authenticates, try another client before stopping.

## Inputs

- **Pull request number** (optional). If omitted, use the pull request for the current branch.
- **Finding** (optional). A comment id, a file and line, or a quote of the title. If omitted, use the unresolved Hansi finding the user is talking about. If several match, ask which one.
- **Rule** (optional). If the user did not state a lasting preference, ask once, then stop until they answer. Do not invent a rule.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the pull request and the finding

```bash
if [ -n "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json number,url -q '{number: .number, url: .url}'
else
  gh pr view --json number,url -q '{number: .number, url: .url}'
fi
```

Use the `number` as `<PR_NUMBER>`. Stop if there is no open pull request.

Read the summary comment (the issue comment whose body contains `<!-- hans:summary -->`) and take the mention handle from the footer `Comment <code>@hansi-codes review</code>`. Review comments are authored by `<slug>[bot]`.

```bash
gh api --paginate "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<PR_NUMBER>/comments?per_page=100" \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("<!-- hans:summary -->"))] | sort_by(.updated_at) | last | .body'
```

List unresolved threads and keep the ones whose first comment is from `<slug>[bot]`:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($cursor: String) {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $cursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 20) {
            nodes { databaseId body path author { login } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Page with `endCursor` while `hasNextPage` is true. The finding comment's `databaseId` is `<COMMENT_ID>`. A finding starts with a bold title, then the explanation, and a footer like `Major · bug`.

If the user did not identify a finding and more than one Hansi thread is unresolved, ask which one. Do not reply on every thread.

### 2. Write the rule

One imperative sentence, understandable without this thread. Name the path or situation it covers.

```
Do not flag missing error handling in tests.
```

A one-off ("ignore this once", "this line is fine today") is not a rule. Say so and stop without posting.

Show the sentence to the user when they did not write it themselves, and wait for a yes before posting.

### 3. Reply on that thread

The reply must be plain text on the finding. Do not mention `@<slug> review`. A review mention starts a new review.

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies" \
  -f body='Do not flag missing error handling in tests. This is a lasting review rule for this repository.'
```

Lead with the rule. Say that it is a lasting review rule for this repository so Hansi treats it as a preference to remember, not a one-off.

### 4. Wait for Hansi

Hansi reacts with 👀, then comments. Poll the thread for about 5 minutes (30 attempts, 10 seconds apart). A new comment from `<slug>[bot]` after the reply is the answer.

Read that comment:

- Hansi agrees and says it will follow the rule: the preference is saved. Future reviews of this repository use it. The summary comment updates when the finding is dismissed.
- Hansi disagrees, or treats the reply as a one-off: the rule was not saved. Quote the answer and stop. Do not post a second reply unless the user asks.

### 5. Report

```
hansi-learn
  Pull request:  #123
  Finding:       src/auth.test.ts:12 — "Missing error handling"
  Rule:          Do not flag missing error handling in tests.
  Saved:         yes
```

Include the pull request URL. When it was not saved, set `Saved` to `no` and quote Hansi's reply.
