# hansi-setup

Write `.hansi.json` at the repository root and get it onto the pull request's base branch. Hansi reads that file, and the guideline files, from the base branch only. A copy that exists solely on a feature branch does nothing until it is merged.

Do not request a Hansi review. Do not push to the default branch. Do not enable `reviews.approveOutsideContributors` unless the user explicitly asks.

The command blocks are examples, written for git and the GitHub CLI. Run whatever this environment actually provides to do the same job, including commands the examples do not list. If `gh` or `git` is missing, or a command fails because of how this machine authenticates, try another client before stopping. Prefer a Git remote this environment can already authenticate to.

## Inputs

- **What to change** (optional). For example a profile, paths to skip, or an instruction. If omitted, inspect the repo and propose a minimal file, then wait for a yes before committing.

## Instructions

### 1. Read the config Hansi uses today

`origin` may be a fork. The branch Hansi reads is on the pull request's base repository, which can be a different repo.

`parent` does not include `nameWithOwner` or a default branch. Build the parent repository from its owner and name.

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,isFork,parent,defaultBranchRef \
  --jq '{repo: .nameWithOwner, fork: .isFork, parent: (if .parent then (.parent.owner.login + "/" + .parent.name) else null end), defaultBranch: .defaultBranchRef.name}'
```

If this checkout is a fork, look up the pull request on `parent`. Otherwise look it up on `repo`. That repository is `<PR_REPO>`.

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <PR_REPO> --json number,url -q '{number: .number, url: .url}'
```

Leave `<PR_NUMBER>` empty to use the current branch. If that lookup fails, try the other of `repo` and `parent`.

Read the base from that pull request. Do not take it from `origin`.

```bash
gh api "repos/<PR_REPO>/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>" \
  --jq '{base: .base.ref, baseRepo: .base.repo.full_name, headRepo: .head.repo.full_name, headOwner: .head.repo.owner.login}'
```

`<BASE>` is `base`. `<BASE_REPO>` is `baseRepo`. `<HEAD_REPO>` is `headRepo`. `<HEAD_OWNER>` is `headOwner`.

If there is no pull request and this checkout is a fork, `<BASE_REPO>` is `parent`. `<BASE>` is that parent's default branch, not the fork's `defaultBranch`. Those names can differ. Read it from the parent repository:

```bash
gh repo view <PARENT> --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name
```

If there is no pull request and this checkout is not a fork, `<BASE_REPO>` is `repo` and `<BASE>` is `defaultBranch`. `<HEAD_REPO>` is `repo`. `<HEAD_OWNER>` is the owner of `<HEAD_REPO>`.

Read `.hansi.json` from `<BASE_REPO>`:

```bash
gh api "repos/<BASE_REPO>/contents/.hansi.json?ref=<BASE>" --jq .content | base64 -d
```

A 404 means there is no file yet. Instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.hansi*`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) are loaded from the pull request head, not this base ref. Do not copy them into `instructions`.

### 2. Decide the edits

Every field is optional. Omit a field when it would only restate the default. Keep unknown keys that are already in the file.

| Field                                | Default    | Write it when                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reviews.enabled`                    | `true`     | The user wants reviews off in this repo.                        |
| `reviews.auto`                       | `true`     | The user wants mentions only.                                   |
| `reviews.drafts`                     | `false`    | The user wants drafts reviewed.                                 |
| `reviews.baseBranches`               | `[]` (all) | The user names branches to review into.                         |
| `reviews.pathFilters`                | `[]`       | The user wants extra excludes, or an allowlist.                 |
| `reviews.profile`                    | `balanced` | The user wants `chill` or `strict`.                             |
| `reviews.minSeverity`                | `minor`    | The user sets `info`, `minor`, `major`, or `critical`.          |
| `reviews.maxComments`                | `15`       | The user sets a cap from 0 to 100.                              |
| `reviews.approve`                    | `true`     | The user does not want automatic approval.                      |
| `reviews.requestChanges`             | `major`    | The user sets `info`, `minor`, `major`, `critical`, or `never`. |
| `reviews.approveOutsideContributors` | `false`    | The user explicitly wants fork authors approved.                |
| `instructions`                       | `""`       | A repo-wide rule that is not already in a guideline file.       |
| `pathInstructions`                   | `[]`       | A rule for one glob, such as `migrations/**`.                   |
| `language`                           | `en`       | The user wants comments in another language.                    |

`profile`: `chill` flags confirmed bugs only. `balanced` also flags risky patterns, weak or missing tests, and broken documentation examples. `strict` also counts naming, style, and maintainability.

`pathFilters`: a pattern without `!` is an allowlist, and files outside it are skipped. A pattern with `!` excludes. Do not add an allowlist unless the user asked for one. Lockfiles, `dist/`, `build/`, snapshots, generated files, and images are already ignored. Do not repeat those.

Always set `$schema` to `https://hansi.codes/schema/v1.json`.

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://hansi.codes/schema/v1.json",
	"reviews": {
		"pathFilters": ["!docs/**"]
	},
	"instructions": "We use Result types instead of exceptions in src/domain.",
	"pathInstructions": [
		{ "path": "migrations/**", "instructions": "Check that every migration is reversible." }
	]
}
```

Show the diff of the file and wait for a yes when the user did not already specify the exact contents.

### 3. Put the file on the base branch

If `git status --short` shows changes you did not make for this config, stop and ask. Do not stash or discard them.

Check out a new branch from `<BASE>` on `<BASE_REPO>` unless the user asked to add the file to the branch they are already on. `origin/<BASE>` on a fork can be a stale copy of a different repository.

Fetch through a remote this environment can already authenticate to. Use an existing remote whose URL is `<BASE_REPO>`. If none exists, add one with the same protocol as the user's other GitHub remotes (SSH or HTTPS), then fetch that remote. Do not fetch a raw `https://github.com/<BASE_REPO>.git` URL when credentials are configured only for another remote. That URL skips SSH keys and credential helpers, so the fetch can fail even when `git fetch` on the existing remote works.

```bash
git fetch <REMOTE> "+refs/heads/<BASE>:refs/remotes/<REMOTE>/<BASE>"
git checkout -b hansi-config "<REMOTE>/<BASE>"
```

If `hansi-config` already exists, pick another branch name. Use the branch you created as `<BRANCH>`.

Write `.hansi.json` at the repository root. Commit only that file. Push `<BRANCH>` to `<HEAD_REPO>` through a remote that already authenticates to that repository. When `origin` is `<HEAD_REPO>`, that remote is `origin`. When it is not, use or add a remote for `<HEAD_REPO>` the same way as the fetch above. Do not push to a raw HTTPS URL that this environment has no credentials for.

```bash
git add .hansi.json
git commit -m "Configure Hansi reviews."
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Open the pull request on `<BASE_REPO>`. When `<HEAD_REPO>` and `<BASE_REPO>` are the same repository:

```bash
gh pr create --repo "<BASE_REPO>" --base "<BASE>" --head "<BRANCH>" \
  --title "Configure Hansi reviews" \
  --body "Adds .hansi.json. Hansi reads it from the base branch after merge."
```

When they differ, the head is the fork branch `<HEAD_OWNER>:<BRANCH>`:

```bash
gh pr create --repo "<BASE_REPO>" --base "<BASE>" --head "<HEAD_OWNER>:<BRANCH>" \
  --title "Configure Hansi reviews" \
  --body "Adds .hansi.json. Hansi reads it from the base branch after merge."
```

If the user asked to include it in the current pull request, commit it on that branch instead and say it takes effect once that pull request merges into `<BASE>` on `<BASE_REPO>`.

### 4. Report

```
hansi-setup
  Base repository: owner/repo
  Base branch:     main
  Pull request:    https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
  Takes effect:    after merge

Changed:
  - reviews.pathFilters: ["!docs/**"]
  - instructions: We use Result types instead of exceptions in src/domain.
```

Say which guideline files already exist on `<BASE>`, so the user knows Hansi will read those too.
